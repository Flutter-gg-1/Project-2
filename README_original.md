# Library System Project ðŸ“š

Welcome to the Library System Project! This project involves creating a command-line application in Dart to manage a library. The system will allow users to perform various operations based on their role: Admin or Customer.

## Project Overview

You will develop a Library System that can perform the following operations:

- **Add a Book**: Add new books to the library.
- **Remove a Book**: Remove books from the library.
- **Buy a Book**: Purchase a book if it's available.
- **Display Receipt**: Show a receipt for the purchase.
