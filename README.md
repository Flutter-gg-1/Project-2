# Library System Project ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **Library System Project**! This command-line application, built with Dart, allows users to manage a library system by performing various operations based on their role: **Admin** or **Customer**.

## Installation

1. **Install Dart**: Ensure Dart is installed on your system. You can download it from [Dart's official website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/turki-aloufi/Project-2.git
    ```
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Project-2
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    dart run
    ```

## Dataset

- The application uses a JSON dataset stored in `bin/data_set.dart`.

## Project Structure

### Models

- **`Library`**: Manages a collection of `Book` objects and a shopping cart (`List<BookOrder>`). It provides various methods for interacting with the books and the cart.
- **`Book`**: Represents a book in the system with attributes like `id`, `title`, `categories`, `price`, etc.

### Classes

- **`BookOrder`**: Represents an order, containing a `Book` object and the quantity ordered. It is used to populate the cart.
- **`Receipt`**: Represents a purchase receipt, containing an `id`, a `cart` (list of `BookOrder` objects), and the total price. It also includes a `printReceipt()` method for printing the receipt.

### Other Files

- **`admin.dart`**: Contains the `printAdminUi()` function, which displays the admin options and includes error handling.
- **`customer.dart`**: Contains the `printCustomerUi()` function, which displays the customer options and includes error handling.
